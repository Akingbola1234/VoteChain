## Inspiration Behind Votechain

Centralized voting system has led to a lot of controversies and illegal appointments in different countries all over the world. Citizens suffer for lack of secured, transparent, decentralized means of voting and appointing leaders. Even so-called independent bodies assigned to be in charge of free and fair elections aren’t independent and can be manipulated. Citizens stopped exercising their voting rights because of lack of trust and transparent means of Election and voting exercise.

Imagine a Decentralized voting system, **secured**, **stress free**, **transparent** to Citizens, winners are not selected by a body, but selected based on the number of votes verified by the Smart contract and announced automatically with **ChainLink Automation**, yes that’s Votechain.

## Problems Votechain is Solving

Votechain has been developed by the team to solving several problems in the voting system of different nations of the world, but these are some of the problems we are solving:

1. Manual Counting and Tabulation: Paper-based voting requires manual counting and tabulation of votes, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. The risk of miscounting or misinterpreting ballots increases, potentially leading to inaccurate results. **Votechain** Results are counted automatically by the smart contract, and with **ChainLink Automation** Winners are picked base on the highest number of votes.

2. Ballot Design and Complexity: Poorly designed or confusing ballots can create difficulties for voters, especially those with low literacy levels or visual impairments. Ambiguous instructions or unclear candidate choices can result in voter confusion and unintentional errors. This is the reason why we have made sure **Votechain** User Interface and User Experience is has simple and direct as possible, both on desktop and mobile.

3. **Ballot Security**: The physical handling and transportation of paper ballots raise concerns about security. Ballot boxes may be vulnerable to tampering, theft, or damage, compromising the integrity of the voting process. Imagine not having to leave the comfort of your home to perform your voting exercise all process done from a comfortable atmosphere in your home, without the thought of security etc.

4. **Voter's Verification:** Verifying the identity of voters and ensuring that each voter casts only one vote can be challenging in paper-based systems. Which is the reason we have developed a system that requires the voter's National Identity Number which is unique to each voter, and we have made sure that a National Identity Number and a wallet address can only vote once on Votechain.

5. **Lack of Transparency** : Paper-based voting systems often lack transparency and easily auditable processes, paper-based voting systems are not easy to track or audit, counters are human beings and can decide to manipulate numbers which won't be easy to track, this is the reason we have picked blockchain to be the solid foundation of the development of Votechain, all vote casted and counted can be tracked on the blockchain by the general public not just a centralized body.

6. **Votechain also addresses the issue of voter apathy.** By offering a user-friendly interface and eliminating barriers to participation, citizens are encouraged to exercise their voting rights. With a decentralized system, citizens have full control over their votes, allowing them to actively shape the future of their communities.

7. **Biased and lack of independence in electoral bodies** Votechain solve the perception of bias and lack of independence in electoral bodies responsible for organizing and overseeing elections further erodes trust in the system. Accusations of favoritism, lack of transparency, and political interference undermine the credibility of electoral bodies and raise questions about the fairness of the electoral process.

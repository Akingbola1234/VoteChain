## Inspiration Behind Votechain

Centralized voting system has led to a lot of controversies and illegal appointments in different countries all over the world. Citizens suffer for lack of secured, transparent, decentralized means of voting and appointing leaders. Even so-called independent bodies assigned to be in charge of free and fair elections aren’t independent and can be manipulated. Citizens stopped exercising their voting rights because of lack of trust and transparent means of Election and voting exercise.

Imagine a Decentralized voting system, **secured**, **stress free**, **transparent** to Citizens, winners are not selected by a body, but selected based on the number of votes verified by the Smart contract and announced automatically with **ChainLink Automation**, yes that’s Votechain.
